# Athena Project: Comprehensive Overview

## Project Description
Athena is an advanced fact-checking and educational platform designed to combat misinformation in real-time. The system processes claims through a sophisticated pipeline that extracts, verifies, and provides educational context for various statements or content. Built with a modern microservices architecture, Athena combines machine learning, natural language processing, and real-time data streaming to deliver accurate fact-checking results.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### a) Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time WebSocket communication
  - Interactive user interface for submitting claims
  - Live progress tracking
  - Educational content display
  - Responsive design for various devices

#### b) Backend
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - WebSocket server for real-time updates
  - Integration with fact-checking pipeline
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data validation and serialization

#### c) Fact-Checking Pipeline
- **Claim Handling**:
  - Claim extraction and preprocessing
  - Claim disambiguation
  - Claim decomposition

- **Verification Engine**:
  - Evidence collection
  - Source credibility assessment
  - Fact verification algorithms
  - Confidence scoring

- **Educational Component**:
  - Contextual explanations
  - Related educational content
  - Source analysis

### 2. Data Flow

1. **Input Phase**:
   - User submits content/claim through the web interface
   - Content is processed by the claim extraction module

2. **Processing Phase**:
   - Claims are disambiguated and decomposed
   - Parallel verification of claims
   - Source credibility assessment
   - Evidence collection and analysis

3. **Output Phase**:
   - Verdict generation (TRUE/FALSE/REFUTED)
   - Confidence scoring
   - Educational context generation
   - Source attribution

## Technical Implementation

## API Documentation

### HTTP Endpoints
- `POST /api/start-analysis` - Initiate fact-checking process
- `GET /api/status` - Check analysis status
- `POST /api/stop` - Stop ongoing analysis
- `GET /api/health` - System health check

### WebSocket Endpoints
- `WS /ws` - Real-time updates stream

## Data Models

### Claim
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `content`: The actual claim text
- `status`: Processing status
- `verdict`: Final result (TRUE/FALSE/REFUTED)
- `confidence`: Confidence score (0-1)
- `sources`: List of referenced sources
- `timestamp`: When the claim was processed

### Source
- `url`: Source URL
- `reliability_score`: Calculated reliability metric
- `bias_rating`: Political/social bias assessment
- `domain_authority`: Domain credibility score
